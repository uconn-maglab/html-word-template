# HTML Word Template

A template to let you write in HTML and have it look like a Word document.

## For more information

See the [web site](http://cranndarach.github.io/html-word-template) for information about how to use it. You don't need to know CSS---or even much HTML---to make use of it. Let me know if you want help with it!

## Why it's cool:

* Save default styles via stylesheets
    * Especially helpful for accessibility control: e.g., if your eyes are sensitive to bright-white pages
    * Also allows you to change the interface background, which is not an option on all word processors
    * Save different stylesheets for different publication style (e.g., APA, MLA)
* Write the text in the editor of your choice, and worry about program-specific compatibility later
    * Avoid the bulkiness of word processors
    * Set up your environment how you want it
* Guidelines to tell you where to break up the text into a new page
* When writing in HTML, **you can comment out any parts you're hesitant about**, hiding them from the document preview without having to delete them altogether
* Speaking of comments, you can add revision-style comments with the `<comment></comment>` wrapper (for the text you're commenting on) and the `<ctext></ctext>` wrapper for the comment itself
* Keeping track of changes using git is much easier for HTML files than for word-processed files
